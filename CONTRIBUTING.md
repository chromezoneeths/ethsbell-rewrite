# Contributing

Please follow these guidelines when making contributions to ETHSBell.

* Configure your IDE to use tabs to indent. It works better for everyone. You can set the size of a tab to whatever you like.
* Try to ensure that the project at least compiles for any given commit.
* We don't have many integration tests yet, but once we do, please make sure you run them before tagging a version.
* Please make sure your tags follow semver.
  * The rightmost number must be incremented only when bugs and regressions have been fixed and no additions have been made.
  * The middle number must be incremented only when features have been added and no incompatible changes have been made.
  * The leftmost number must be incremented only when incompatible changes have been made.
