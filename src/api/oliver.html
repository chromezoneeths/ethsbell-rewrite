			Beloved son of Alexander Brown and Mary Leopold, brother to Miles Leopold, adored grandson of Ronald and
			Ellen
			Brown, Carolyn Kaplan, and Thomas and Janet Leopold. Cherished nephew of Jennifer Leopold and Steven Katz,
			Joanne
			Leopold, James Donohue and Martha Grover, Dana and Jeanne Brown, Emily and Adam Rudman, Elizabeth Kaplan,
			Andrew
			Goodwin and Sarah Heil, Elizabeth Goodwin and Fred Roberts, and beloved cousin to many. Oliver was an
			extraordinary person who accomplished more than seems possible in his 19 years. His passion for serving the
			community, seeking solutions to problems and challenging himself to reach new heights central to his
			essence.
			Oliver was a computer whiz, entrepreneur, YouTube phenom, camp counselor, published author, first responder,
			pep
			rally leader, triathlete, youngest stock trader to be interviewed on a national program, animal lover, and
			strict
			vegan who was deeply appreciated by all who knew him. He graduated early from high school so he could become
			an
			EMT on the front lines during COVID, working both on an ambulance and in an emergency room. Oliver took a
			gap year
			so he could become a paramedic and continue to be of service. In addition, he was a passionate Fire Explorer
			through the Evanston Fire Department and was inspired to create an App that was immediately adopted by
			Evanston
			Fire Dept. In high school, he was the voice that greeted every Evanston High School student over the loud
			speaker
			each morning and created an App that revolutionized the way students navigated their schedules. Above and
			beyond
			all his inventions and accolades, Oliver was deeply compassionate, curious, and engaged. He was a loyal and
			loving
			friend to many. He wanted so much to make the world a better place, and he most certainly did.

			Thank you, Oliver, for founding the codETHS club. I didn't have any friends after I transferred, but the
			codETHS
			club gave me a place to share my interests and contribute to the ETHS community. I didn't know you very
			well, but
			you made a greater impact on my life than you might have realized. Thank you for making the best part of my
			high
			school career possible.

				Oliver was a great person to be around. I have many great memories with him. In the ChromeZone, at tech
				conferences, or even just working together remotely. We did lots of great work while also just enjoying
				ourselves and doing what we loved.
			</p>
			<p>
				Oliver's idea to create a code club allowed for us to have an even larger impact on the school and
				create
				things that impact thousands of students every day. We also got the opportunity to share our love for
				programming and created a community of people with a common interest, working towards a common goal. And
				it
				allowed me to further expand my love for programming and make an impact of my own. For that, I am
				grateful.
			</p>
			<p>
				When he graduated to start his work as an EMT, I continued to run the club in his absence. And I'm sure
				that
				once I graduate, there will be others who continue on the legacy. Oliver, your contributions will not be
				forgotten. Thank you.</p>
